# Coffee-Expansion-Project
This project aims to assist a growing coffee shop business in making data-driven decisions about where to expand its outlets. By analyzing historical sales, customer demographics, and city data using MySQL, we uncover valuable insights that help management identify high-performing products, top customer locations, and market trends.
